# Core Python Exercises
These are my solutions to the exercises from the book [Core Python](http://corepython.com/)

I have shared this on Github for the following reasons

* To keep a track of my progress.
* To be able to access the code from anywhere.
* So that it motivates me to solve more exercises.
* In the hope that some pythonista might see this repo and suggest me towards making the code pythonic :-)

Feel free to fork this repo if it may help you in any way.
